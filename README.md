# Yaqubi-MADA-project

## Overview

This repository contains a reproducible data analysis pipeline that examines whether younger individuals with clinically normal serum cholesterol levels face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) when secondary risk factors such as elevated blood pressure or ST depression, are present.

## Folder Structure

Top-level directories:

-   `assets/`

-   `code/`

-   `data/`

-   `results/`

-   `products/`

-   Other project files: `.gitignore`, `.here`, `data-analysis-template.Rproj`, `project-review-*.qmd`, etc. ([github.com](https://github.com/Murtaza-Yaqubi/Yaqubi-MADA-project))

### `assets/` Directory

The `assets/` directory holds static resources used throughout the project, including bibliographic references:

-   `assets/references/`: Contains the project's citation files.

    -   `project-citations.bib`: BibTeX file listing all references used in analyses and the manuscript.

### `code/` Directory

The `code/` directory contains all analysis scripts and Quarto files, organized by stage:

-   `processing-code/`: Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts.

-   `eda-code/`: Exploratory Data Analysis scripts, generating summary statistics and visualizations.

-   `analysis-code/`: Inferential statistical analysis and predictive modeling scripts.

-   `full_code/`: A single Quarto document combining all analysis steps into one comprehensive pipeline. ([github.com](https://github.com/Murtaza-Yaqubi/Yaqubi-MADA-project/tree/main/code))

### `data/` Directory

The `data/` directory holds raw and processed datasets:

-   `raw-data/`: Contains the original `Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset.csv` and its variable description PDF.

-   `processed-data/`: Contains the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_df.rds`) and associated codebook. ([github.com](https://github.com/Murtaza-Yaqubi/Yaqubi-MADA-project/tree/main/data))

### `results/` Directory

The `results/` directory stores outputs generated by the analysis code:

-   `figures/`: Visualizations (PNG files) from EDA and modeling.

-   `tables/`: RDS tables of summary statistics and model results. ([github.com](https://github.com/Murtaza-Yaqubi/Yaqubi-MADA-project/tree/main/results))

### `products/` Directory

The `products/` directory contains the final deliverables:

-   `manuscript/`: Includes `Manuscript.qmd`, and `manuscript.docx`. ([github.com](https://github.com/Murtaza-Yaqubi/Yaqubi-MADA-project/tree/main/products))

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```         
    git clone https://github.com/Murtaza-Yaqubi/Yaqubi-MADA-project.git
    cd Yaqubi-MADA-project
    ```

2.  **Open the project in RStudio**\
    Launch `data-analysis-template.Rproj` to set the working directory to the project root.

3.  **Install prerequisites**

    -   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (\>= 4.0)

    -   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

    -   Required R packages (as used in the Quarto files; e.g., `tidyverse`, `broom`, etc.). Consider using `renv` for reproducible environments.

4.  **Run the analysis**

    -   **Data processing**:

        ```         
        quarto render code/processing-code/01_data_cleaning.qmd
        ```

        This command executes the data cleaning Quarto document, running all preprocessing steps and generating both the cleaned dataset (e.g., `cleaned_df.rds`) and an HTML report summarizing the cleaning process.

    -   **Exploratory Data Analysis**:

        ```         
        quarto render code/eda-code/eda-code.qmd
        ```

    -   This commands run the EDA Quarto documents to produce summary statistics and visualizations.

    -   **Statistical Analysis & Modeling**:

        ```         
        quarto render code/analysis-code/analysis-code.qmd
        ```

        This commands execute the statistical inference and modeling Quarto files, generating model outputs, diagnostics, and HTML reports in the `analysis-code` folder.

    -   **Full pipeline**:

        ```         
        quarto render code/full_code/full_code.qmd
        ```

        This single command runs the comprehensive Quarto document that combines all steps—from data cleaning through modeling—in one pipeline, producing a complete HTML report.

    -   **Manuscript**:

        ```         
        quarto render products/manuscript/Manuscript.qmd
        ```

5.  **View results**

    -   Cleaned data: `data/processed-data/cleaned_df.rds`

    -   Figures: `results/figures/`

    -   Tables: `results/tables/`

    -   Final manuscript: `products/manuscript/Manuscript.qmd` and `manuscript.docx`
