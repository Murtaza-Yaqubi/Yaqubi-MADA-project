	abstract = {Background In unstable coronary artery disease, ST-segment depression indicates a poor prognosis. We evaluated whether the effect of early revascularization and the extent of coronary lesions were related to ST-segment and T wave changes on admission.Methods and Results 2457 patients with unstable coronary artery disease were randomized to an early invasive strategy with coronary angiography/revascularization within 7 days or to a non-invasive strategy with coronary procedures only when symptoms or severe ischaemia recurred. ST depression was present in 1114 (45¶5\%) patients. In the invasive group, 45\% of the patients with ST depression had three-vessel disease or left main stenosis compared with 22\% if no ST-segment depression was present, PP=0¶004 while mortality was changed from 5¶8 to 3¶3\%, P=0¶050. In patients without ST-segment depression the corresponding rates concerning death/myocardial infarction were 10¶4 and 8¶9, and for mortality 2¶0 and 1¶2\% (non-significant).Conclusions In unstable coronary artery disease, ST-segment depression is associated with a 100\% increase in the occurrence of three-vessel/left main disease and to an increased risk of subsequent cardiac events. In these patients an early invasive strategy substantially decreases death/myocardial infarction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Absence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) is traditionally considered low risk for atherosclerosis; however, individuals without CVRFs, as currently defined, still have events.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis in CVRF-free individuals.
METHODS: Participants from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study (n = 4,184) without conventional CVRFs were evaluated (n = 1,779; 45.0 ± 4.1 years, 50.3\% women). CVRF freedom was defined as no current smoking and untreated blood pressure {\textless}140/90 mm Hg, fasting glucose {\textless}126 mg/dl, total cholesterol {\textless}240 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) {\textless}160 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥40 mg/dl. A subgroup with optimal CVRFs (n = 740) was also defined as having blood pressure {\textless}120/80 mm Hg, fasting glucose {\textless}100 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin {\textless}5.7\%, and total cholesterol {\textless}200 mg/dl. We evaluated ultrasound-detected carotid, iliofemoral, and abdominal aortic plaques; coronary artery calcification; serum biomarkers; and lifestyle. Adjusted odds ratios (with 95\% confidence interval) and ordinal logistic regression models were used.
RESULTS: Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7\% of CVRF-free participants. Together with male sex and age, LDL-C was independently associated with atherosclerosis presence and extent, in both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups (odds ratio [×10 mg/dl]: 1.14 to 1.18; p {\textless} 0.01 for all). Atherosclerosis presence and extent was also associated in the CVRF-free group with glycosylated hemoglobin levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Many CVRF-free middle-aged individuals have atherosclerosis. LDL-C, even at levels currently considered normal, is independently associated with the presence and extent of early systemic atherosclerosis in the absence of major CVRFs. These findings support more effective LDL-C lowering for primordial prevention, even in individuals conventionally considered at optimal risk.

	issn = {1097-6868},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ajog.2020.10.049},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension was redefined in 2017 with lower diagnostic thresholds; elevated blood pressure is defined as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 129 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure of {\textless}80 mm Hg and stage 1 hypertension as systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg. These guidelines did not include pregnant women. There is limited information on stage 1 hypertension and pregnancy outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether elevated blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension as newly defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, 18,801 women with singletons from 2013 to 2019 were categorized as normotensive, prehypertensive (elevated blood pressure), stage 1 hypertensive, or chronic hypertensive. Women with ≥2 systolic blood pressures of 120 to 129 mm Hg before 20 weeks' gestation were classified into the elevated blood pressure group. Women with ≥2 systolic blood pressures of 130 to 139 mm Hg or ≥2 diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 89 mm Hg before 20 weeks' gestation were assigned to the stage 1 hypertension group. Women were classified as chronic hypertensives if they had any of the following: ≥2 systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm Hg or ≥2 diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg before 20 weeks' gestation, a history of chronic hypertension, or antihypertensive medication use before 20 weeks' gestation. Women with pregestational diabetes, lupus, or {\textless}2 blood pressures before 20 weeks' gestation were excluded. The association of stage 1 hypertension with the risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was estimated using multivariate logistic regression controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics, gestational weight gain by prepregnancy body mass index, parity, and aspirin use. Secondary outcomes included subgroups of hypertensive disorders (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome), gestational diabetes, placental abruption, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, stillbirth and neonatal death, and maternal intensive care unit admission. All outcomes were adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of the 18,801 women, 13,478 (71.7\%) were normotensive, 2659 (14.1\%) had elevated blood pressure, 1384 (7.4\%) were stage 1 hypertensive, and 1280 (6.8\%) were chronic hypertensive. A dose-response relationship was observed: the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increased from 4.2\% in normotensive women to 6.7\% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95\% confidence interval, 1.26-1.79) in women with elevated blood pressure, to 10.9\% (adjusted odds ratio, 2.54; 95\% confidence interval, 2.09-3.08) in women with stage 1 hypertension, and 28.4\% (adjusted odds ratio, 7.14; 95\% confidence interval, 6.06-8.40) in women with chronic hypertension. Compared with normotensive women, women with stage 1 hypertension had an increased risk of neonatal intensive care unit admissions (15.8\% vs 13.0\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.21; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03-1.42), preterm birth at {\textless}37 weeks' gestation (7.2\% vs 5.2\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.45; 95\% confidence interval, 1.16-1.81), and gestational diabetes (14.8\% vs 6.8\%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.68; 95\% confidence interval, 2.27-3.17).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that elevated blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension, using the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guideline definition, are associated with increased maternal and neonatal risk. This group of women warrants further investigation to determine whether pregnancy management can be altered to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, characterized by a spectrum of conditions ranging from unstable angina to myocardial infarction. Traditionally perceived as a disease predominantly affecting older adults, ACS is increasingly being recognized in younger populations, raising concerns about its etiology, presentation, and management in this age group. Aims: The findings will highlight the distinctive characteristics and needs of the very young CAD patients, underlining the necessity for targeted interventions in this emerging subset. This study is especially essential for India, given its significant and growing young population vulnerable to CVD. Materials and Methods: his study was an investigator-initiated, single-center, retrospective observational study aimed at examining the clinico-demographic, risk factors, and angiographic profiles of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in young adults at a tertiary Cardiology Institute in Central India. Approved by the local ethical committee and conducted according to ICH Harmonized Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the study involved a review of medical records from 550 young adults (aged 18 to = 45 years) diagnosed with ACS between January 2018 and July 2023. Result: The comparative analysis of coronary angiographic profiles by age group. Among the cases with single-vessel disease, 22 (8.9\%) were under 30 years, while 226 (91.1\%) were over 30 years. In cases of double-vessel disease, 1 (0.7\%) was under 30 years, and 140 (99.3\%) were over 30 years. Notably, no patients under 30 years had triple-vessel disease, whereas all 92 (100\%) cases of triple-vessel disease occurred in patients over 30 years. Conclusion: Our study provides valuable insights into the clinicodemographic characteristics, risk factors, and angiographic profiles of ACS in young adults. Young ACS patients exhibit a strong male predominance. Although Obesity and hypertension emerged as the most common risk factor, affecting around 40\% of participants, conventional risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, are significantly less prevalent in patients younger than 30 years compare to older young patients.},
