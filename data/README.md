# data

This folder is organized into two subfolders that contain the datasets used for the analysis. The raw-data folder holds the original, unprocessed dataset in CSV format, preserving the data as it was received. The processed-data folder contains the cleaned and processed version of the dataset, saved in RDS format, which is ready for analysis. This structure helps maintain a clear separation between the original data and the version that has been prepared for further processing and modeling.
