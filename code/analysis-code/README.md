# analysis-code

Overview

This R script performs statistical analysis and visualization on a processed cardiovascular disease dataset. It loads the cleaned dataset, computes summary statistics, generates interaction visualizations, conducts Chi-Square tests, and fits logistic regression models (including interactions and adjusted models). The results, including tables and figures, are saved for further review.
