# Introduction

## General Background Information

Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as coronary heart disease or ischemic heart disease. It’s also what most people mean when they use the general term “heart disease.” It is a common and serious condition where plaque buildup in the coronary arteries restricts blood flow to the heart. This gradual narrowing, caused by atherosclerosis, often develops over years without symptoms until a heart attack occurs, making CAD a "silent killer." Symptoms, when present, include chest pain and shortness of breath. As the leading cause of death in the U.S. and globally, CAD claimed 375,500 lives in the U.S. in 2021 and affects over 18 million American adults.

## Description of data and data source

This dataset contains anonymized patient records related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and diagnoses. Each row represents a patient, with features like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and clinical indicators (e.g., ST depression, chest pain type).

This heart disease dataset is acquired from one o f the multispecialty hospitals in India. This dataset consists of 1000 subjects so each row represents a patient, with features like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and clinical indicators (e.g., ST depression, chest pain type). This dataset was obtained from mendeley data where it was first published in April of 2021.

This dataset can be accessed at <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dzz48mvjht/1>

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

Do younger individuals (e.g., age \< 40) with normal cholesterol levels (within "healthy" range) still face CVD risk if they have elevated blood pressure or ST depression (oldpeak)?

# Methods

For this analysis I will be using target which is the outcome of interest and is described as abcense or pressence of heart disease and some of the predictors of interest are age, serum cholesterol, resting BP, and old peak. The goal for this analysis is to be able observe if young patients with normal cholesterol but high BP/ST depression have higher CVD rates than expected.

The analysis will first isolate younger individuals with clinically normal cholesterol levels to examine their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) when other factors like high blood pressure or ST depression are present. Patients will be categorized based on these secondary risk factors, and descriptive analysis will compare CVD prevalence among groups, such as those with normal cholesterol but elevated blood pressure versus those with entirely normal profiles. This step aims to reveal potential associations between non-traditional risk factors and CVD in younger populations.

To validate these findings, statistical tests like chi-square analysis will assess significance, while logistic regression models will quantify the independent and combined effects of blood pressure and ST depression on CVD risk, adjusting for confounders like gender and fasting blood sugar. Visualization techniques, including bar plots and boxplots, will further illustrate risk patterns, making the findings more interpretable. By integrating these methods, the study aims to challenge traditional risk-assessment frameworks and support more nuanced screening approaches for younger individuals at risk of CVD.

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender. We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```

*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

## Statistical analysis

*Explain anything related to your statistical analyses.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

*Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project.*

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. I generally recommend the `here` package.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

*Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means.*

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis.*

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like.
