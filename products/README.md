# products

This folder contains all the products of our project, which investigates whether younger individuals with clinically normal cholesterol levels are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease when secondary risk factors, such as elevated blood pressure or ST depression, are present.

manuscript: This folder holds the complete analysis in the form of a Quarto file named manuscript.qmd, which contains all the code and documentation for the study. In addition, it includes a separate document called manuscript.docx that provides a brief introduction to the analysis along with a summary of the key findings.

results: This folder contains all the outputs generated by the analysis. Within the results folder, there are two subfolders:

figures: This subfolder stores all visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, violin plots, and other figures produced during the analysis.

tables: This subfolder contains summary tables and other output tables that support the findings presented in the manuscript.
This organization ensures that all aspects of the project—from the complete analysis code and documentation to the final outputs—are easily accessible and reproducible.
